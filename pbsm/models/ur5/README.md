# Universal Robot UR-5 Model
This model is a very slightly modified version of the model produced by the manufacturer (see [here](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot)). The only modifications made to the XACRO file provided by the package are to disable certain features specifically made for ROS or Gazebo.
